# Advanced-Linear-Regression


A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia

The company wants to know the following things about the prospective properties:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Business Goal

- Build a linear regression model to predict the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
- This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Used Regularization techniques- Ridge and Lasso to study how they can perform better than the normal linear regression.
Data set used here is the Housing Price prediction Dataset to predict the actual value of prospective properties.
